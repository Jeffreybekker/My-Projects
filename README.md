# My-Projects

## Description
<p>In the last years I've done a lot of projects and study abound Python.</p>
<p>First I started from a book called Python Crash Course. I followed along and uploaded it here on GitHub to show what I've done and learned. I learned how to make a game and how to plot graphs with matplotlib etc.</p>
<p>Later I did followed Course from Udemy. Here I learned lots of new things about Python. Every video explained everything you had to know about a certain topic, then after the explaining and examples, you were given a test. First I made everything myself, and later compared the answers with the teacher. Actually my answers were always correct, except I could optimize the code more, which I did afterwards.</p>
<p>All projects are having a descriptive name, so no README.md were needed.</p>
