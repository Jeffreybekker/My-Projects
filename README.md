# My-Projects

## Description
<p>In the last years I've done a lot of projects and study around python. First I started from a book called Python Crash Course. I followed along and uploaded it here on GitHub to show what I've done and learned.</p>
<p>Later I did another Course from Udemy. Here I learned lots of new things about Python. Every video explained everything you had to know about a certain topic, and then after explaining and examples, you were given a test. First I made everything myself, and later compared the answers with the tutor. Actually my answers were always correct, except I could optimize the code more, which I did afterwards.</p>
